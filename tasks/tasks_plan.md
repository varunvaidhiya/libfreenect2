# Task Plan

## Backlog
1. Validate NEON build on Raspberry Pi 5 hardware.
2. Benchmark depth processing performance (FPS, packet loss).
3. Document USB tuning steps and impacts.
4. Explore viewer performance with RGB enabled.
5. Assess feasibility of OpenCL/OpenGL pipelines on Pi.

## In Progress
- Memory documentation structure creation.

## Completed
- Added NEON SIMD optimizations to CPU depth processor.
- Updated CMake flags for ARM builds.

## Blocked
- None at this time.

## Notes
- Update this plan after each major development/testing session.
